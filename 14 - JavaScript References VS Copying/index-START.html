    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // players[1] = 'Tom';
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'Other';
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'new other';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = '4 other';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const tom = {
      name: 'Tom',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: 'Something',
        facebook: 'Something else'
      }
    };
    const dev = Object.assign({}, tom);


    // Very rarely do you need to clone deeply however
    const jsonWay = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tom));

    dev.social.twitter = 'changed';
